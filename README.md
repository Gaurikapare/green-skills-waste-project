# ♻️ Green Skills: Solid Waste Management using AI & Deep Learning

This project focuses on **analyzing and predicting solid waste patterns** in Pune city using **machine learning and deep learning** techniques. It is part of a green skills initiative to promote sustainable urban waste management through data science.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

- Analyze **ward-wise solid waste data** in Pune
- Understand the **impact of segregation and equipment availability**
- Use **ML & Deep Learning** to predict daily waste quantity
- Visualize **error reduction and learning** during model training
- Contribute toward **smart waste planning & environmental sustainability**

---

## 🧾 Datasets Used

1. `solid waste ward wise segregation data.csv`  
2. `waste collection and vehicle data.csv`  
3. `collection equipment data.csv`  

All datasets were cleaned, merged, and preprocessed before applying models.

## ⚙️ Techniques Used

- Data Cleaning with **Pandas & NumPy**
- Visualization with **Matplotlib & Seaborn**
- **Machine Learning**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Polynomial Regression
  - K-Means Clustering
- **Deep Learning**:
  - Neural Network with Keras
  - Training using Gradient Descent
  - Loss curve visualization (MSE)

---

## 🧠 Deep Learning Highlights

- Normalized features with `StandardScaler`
- Neural Network using:
  - `Sequential`, `Dense` layers
  - `ReLU` & `Linear` activation
- Trained model using `.fit()` and visualized loss decrease

---

## 📊 Final Output

- Line graph showing **loss decreasing per epoch**
- Weights (theta) after gradient descent
- Predictions and evaluation (optional future step)

---

## 🌍 Real-world Impact

This project can help municipal corporations:

- Optimize waste vehicle allocation
- Plan for high-waste generation wards
- Increase awareness on segregation
- Improve sustainability through data-driven planning

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements

- Integrate live API waste data from PMC
- Build dashboard using **Streamlit or Gradio**
- Predict waste spikes during festivals/events
- Recommend policy changes for low-performing zones
